# ElectroChemical Interfacial simualtion package (ECINT)

The package contains some workflows designed for simulation of electrocheical systems, which are based on the widely used scientific workflow package `AiiDA` and `ASE`. The simulation of electrochemical system requires a lot of labor works. Therefore, we created this package.

This package is initially led by Jingfang, Yunpei and Yongbin.
